Notepad will open a UNIX-style text file and show the "empty box" unrecognized character instead of the expected line break. Using a more advanced text editor will alleviate these conflicts; the UNIX style produces a smaller script file because each newline only requires 2 bytes (one character) to break the line instead of 4 bytes.
